// Single File Programming Question
// Problem Statement



// Jaanu wants to perform operations on a string. She wants to append the given character to the end of the string and remove the last character from the string. Jaanu needs your help to write a program that performs these operations on the given string.



// Write a program that takes a string and a character as inputs and performs the mentioned operations.



// Company Tags: HCL 

// Input format :
// The first input consists of a string, str.

// The second input consists of a character, ch.

// Output format :
// The first line of output prints the string with the single character "ch" appended at the end.

// The second line prints the original string after the appended character has been removed.



// Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

// Code constraints :
// In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

// 1 ≤ Length of the string ≤ 100

// Sample test cases :
// Input 1 :
// Hello
// X
// Output 1 :
// HelloX
// Hello
// Input 2 :
// ABCD!
// @
// Output 2 :
// ABCD!@
// ABCD!
